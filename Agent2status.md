## Status Update: 2025-09-02

### Diagnosis and Resolution
- **Root Cause:** Python runtime errors in `parser.py` due to incorrect attribute access on BeautifulSoup objects (`.attrs` and direct indexing).
- **Impact:** Prevented extraction of brand, product link, and other fields, causing engine to return incomplete or None data, resulting in `engine_status: ERROR` in sensor.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Patched `parser.py` to check types and use `.get()` only on valid Tag objects.
  - Validated with linter and runtime logs; all errors resolved.
  - Confirmed successful extraction of price, currency, brand, product link, and diagnostics in logs.
- **Current State:**
  - No error status reported in logs.
  - All diagnostics and entity attributes are correctly extracted and logged.

### Next Steps
- If further validation or entity state checks are required, proceed with runtime Home Assistant entity inspection.
- Continue to monitor logs for any new errors or extraction issues.

## Technical Notes
- All changes are documented in `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` for future reference.
- File-based diagnostics and runtime logging are now reliable for debugging extraction issues.
- No hard-coded values; all logic is robust and type-checked.

## Handoff
- Agent2 has completed diagnosis and resolution for the BuyWisely integration error status.
- Ready for further feature development or runtime validation as needed.
