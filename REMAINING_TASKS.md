## Remaining Tasks for Price Tracker Refactoring

This document outlines the remaining steps to complete the refactoring of the `price_tracker` custom component.

### 1. Complete `test_buywisely_engine.py` Fixes

*   **Objective:** Ensure all tests within `test_buywisely_engine.py` pass successfully after the `html_extractor.py` and `engine.py` refactoring.
*   **Details:**
    *   Update the mock HTML content in each test case to include a valid `__NEXT_DATA__` script that the `nextjs_hydration_parser` can correctly process.
    *   Adjust existing assertions in each test to accurately reflect the expected output from the new parsing logic.
*   **Implementation Strategy:** Read the entire `test_buywisely_engine.py` file, construct the corrected content (including updated mock HTML and assertions) in memory, and then overwrite the file using `write_file`. This approach circumvents limitations with multiline string replacements.

### 2. Run All Tests

*   **Objective:** Verify the integrity and functionality of the entire `price_tracker` component after all code modifications.
*   **Details:** Execute the complete test suite (`pytest price_tracker/`) to confirm that no regressions have been introduced and all existing functionalities work as expected.

### 3. Final Review of Documentation (User Stories and Features)

*   **Objective:** Ensure all user-facing and feature-related documentation accurately reflects the current state and behavior of the `price_tracker` component.
*   **Details:** Conduct a quick review of files within `UserStories/*.md` and `features/*.feature` to confirm consistency with the refactored implementation. While core functionality remains, subtle changes in implementation might necessitate minor updates to descriptions or expected outcomes.
