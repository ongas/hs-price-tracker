# User Story 5: Parse and Display Product Information from BuyWisely

**As a** Home Assistant user,
**I want** the integration to extract and display product information (name, brand, image, price, offers) from BuyWisely product pages,
**so that** I can see all relevant details for the products I am tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system parses product HTML and JSON data from BuyWisely pages.
- Product details such as name, brand, image, price, and offers are extracted and shown to the user.
- If parsing fails, the user is notified or fallback logic is used.
