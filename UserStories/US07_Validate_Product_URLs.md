# User Story 7: Validate BuyWisely Product URLs

**As a** Home Assistant user,
**I want** the system to validate BuyWisely product URLs when I add them,
**so that** I am prevented from tracking invalid or malformed product links.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system checks the format of the BuyWisely product URL before adding it.
- If the URL is invalid, the user receives a clear error message.
- Only valid product URLs are accepted for tracking.
