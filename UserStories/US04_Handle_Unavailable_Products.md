# User Story 4: Handle Unavailable or Deleted BuyWisely Products

**As a** Home Assistant user,
**I want** to be notified or see when a BuyWisely product I am tracking becomes unavailable or is deleted,
**so that** I am aware that the product is no longer being tracked or cannot be purchased.

## Acceptance Criteria
- If a tracked product cannot be found or loaded, its status is set to 'deleted' or 'inactive'.
- The product is clearly marked as unavailable in the UI.
- The user is informed of the change in status.
