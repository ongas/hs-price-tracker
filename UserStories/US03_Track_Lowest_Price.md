# User Story 3: Automatically Track the Lowest Price for a BuyWisely Product

**As a** Home Assistant user,
**I want** the integration to always track and display the lowest price available for a BuyWisely product,
**so that** I can be sure I am monitoring the best deal across all offers for that product.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The system parses all available offers for a product from BuyWisely.
- The lowest price and its corresponding seller URL are always selected and displayed.
- If no offers are available, the product is marked as inactive or deleted.
